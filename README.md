# XLIFF Helper

A utility for managing XLIFF translation files.

This utility allows you to:

* Add translation sources, targets, and notes
* Edit existing translation sources, targets, and notes
* Search sources, targets, and notes
* Delete sources, targets, and notes

This utility will do some minor cleanup of the .xliff file, including removing blank sources and validating that each source is unique.
